# dotfiles

My macOS setup. yabai and skhd for tiling, JankyBorders, Neovim (LazyVim), kitty, zsh with starship, lazygit, delta and btop.

Everything uses Catppuccin. Kitty, Neovim, delta, lazygit, bat and btop follow the macOS appearance, Latte when it's light and Mocha when it's dark.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bassepeder/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
brew bundle
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` symlinks the configs into place and checks that yabai and skhd still have their macOS permissions.

yabai isn't in the Brewfile. I run my own fork with fixes for macOS 27, see `yabai/README.md`.

## Local overrides

Anything machine specific (work vs. personal, secrets) lives in untracked files that the configs source if they exist:

- `~/.zshrc.local`
- `~/.gitconfig.local`
- `~/.yabairc.local`
